#Kamon examples
1. [customer-akka-kamon](https://github.com/meetpraveen/scala-kamon-examples/tree/master/customer-akka-kamon) - Kamon integration with simple scala service using actor, akka-http and logback
2. [hello-lagom-kamon](https://github.com/meetpraveen/scala-kamon-examples/tree/master/hello-lagom-kamon) - Kamon integration with lagon application.
  > Lagom application instrumentation works through javaagent injection, the sbt plugin injector is currently not working. Running as fat jar or docker will enable kamon. sbt runall is currently not able to inject kamon instrumentation modules
